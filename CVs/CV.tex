\title{\textbf{Improved Black-Box Constructions of Composable Secure Computation}}
\begin{position}
We construct a $\max(R_\mathsf{OT},\widetilde{O}(\log n))$-round  MPC protocol secure in the {\em angel-based} security model, by way of a constant-round black-box 1-1 CCA commitment scheme. The construction works under the modest assumption of semi-honest oblivious transfer. This closes the gap in round complexity between black-box and non-black-box MPC constructions in this model.

\title{\textbf{Compact Ring Signatures from Learning With Errors}}
\begin{position}
We present the first compact ring signature scheme (i.e., where the size of the signature grows logarithmically with the size of the ring) from the (plain) learning with errors (LWE) problem. The construction is in the standard model and it does not rely on a trusted setup or on the random oracle heuristic. At the heart of our scheme is a new construction of compact and statistically witness-indistinguishable ZAP arguments for $\mathsf{NP \cap coNP}$, that we show to be sound based on the plain LWE assumption. Prior to our work, statistical ZAPs (for all of NP) were known to exist only assuming sub-exponential hardness of LWE.

\title{\textbf{A Note on the Post-Quantum Security of (Ring) Signatures}}
\begin{position}
We consider signatures satisfying blind-unforgeability as recently proposed by Alagic et al. (Eurocryptâ€™20). We present two short signature schemes achieving this notion: one is in the quantum random oracle model, assuming quantum hardness of SIS; and the other is in the plain model, assuming quantum hardness of LWE with super-polynomial modulus. We further propose an analog of blind-unforgeability in the ring signature setting. Moreover, assuming the quantum hardness of LWE, we construct a compiler converting any blind-unforgeable (ordinary) signatures to a ring signature satisfying our definition.

\title{\textbf{Satistfaction Of Boolean String Populations Recurrently Generated By an Underlying Boolean Function}}
\begin{position}
This project aimed to build upon a paper by Papadimitrou et al. which modelled sexual reproduction, by using a Boolean function to model the action of natural selection. We obtained positive results for some specific cases.

\location{Indian Institute of Science}
\dates{Thesis Project (April 2016)}
\title{\textbf{Information Theoretic Secure Computation}}
\begin{position}
 Information theoretic proofs have been known for the fact that only a very trivial class of functions are securely computable, given no additional common resources to the parties. We looked at the problem of what other classes of functions become securely computable given additional common resources to parties.
